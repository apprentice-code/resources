## Program Overview

### Goal
The ultimate goal of a Code Apprentice mentorship is to inspire your student to pursue a career in tech. You can do this by helping them with their coding education, showing them the cool things you're building as a part of your job, and helping them understand the "why" behind software.

### Weekly Meetings
Each week, you'll meet with your student for 2 hours over video chat to review what they've been learning, answer any questions, and, should you desire, work with them on simple coding projects provided in the "Mentor Guided Learning" section of their lesson plan.

### Curriculum
We've provided the students with a [curriculum](https://github.com/apprentice-code/curriculum/lessons) that covers the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Each week, your student will learn a few concepts and then put their knowledge to work with a [coding assignment](https://github.com/apprentice-code/curriculum/tree/master/assignments). Once they've submitted their assignment to Github, you'll be notified by email so you can check their work and see how they did. 

### Reporting
While the goal of a Code Apprentice mentorship is to ultimately inspire students to pursue careers in tech, we've found that accountability is key in ensuring the student remains actively engaged in the program.  We ask that mentors keep us and the school informed of the student's progress by using a reporting tool we've developed. The following reports are sent to the school, the student's parent/guardian, and the student themselves: 

#### Weekly Meeting Report
At the end of each week, we'll send you an email with a link to your reporting dashboard. There, you'll see a form asking if you met with your student that week. If you were unable to meet with your student, please leave a comment with a reason why.

#### Assignment Report
Once your student has completed their weekly assignment and submitted it to Github, we'll notify you via email with a link to your reporting dashboard. There, you'll see a link to their assignment in Github, a grading scale from 1-10, and an additional comment section to provide encouragement or advice to the student when they receive their report. 

#### Grading
Ultimately, the school determines the student's final grade based on the reports provided to them by Code Apprentice. For each assignment, provide your suggested 1-10 grade using the following factors:

- Timely completion of the assignment
- Level of engagement _(Did your student ask questions if they got stuck? Did they put in the necessary effort?)_
- Comprehension of the material

### 1. Install Zoom
We’re using Zoom for video chats and screen-sharing between you and your student. [Create an account](https://zoom.us/signup) and download the application.

### 2. Log into the Code Apprentice Slack community
We use Slack for the Code Apprentice community and for any chat messaging between you and your student. The Code Apprentice Slack community URL is https://code-apprentice.slack.com. If the email you use for your primary Slack account is different than the email you used to sign up to be a mentor, please let us know and we’ll make sure to send the invite to the correct address.

### 3. Schedule the weekly meeting with your student
We do our best to pair mentors with students who have a similar availability. Once we pair you with your student, reach out to them via Slack or email and work out a set time each week that you'll meet.
