## Program Overview

Code Apprentice is a 14-week program that teaches high school students how to build web applications with 1:1 mentorship from a dedicated coding mentor. 

Each week, students: 

1. Learn coding fundamentals (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) using an online, self-driven curriculum 
2. Complete a coding assignment to put into practice the skills they’re learning 
3. Meet over video chat with their coding mentor who can answer any questions and work them on coding projects 

At the end of the 14 weeks, students will work on a final project to combine all of the skills that they have learned.

## Reporting on student progress

During the course of the semester, we ask that the teacher of record ensure that students are:

* meeting with weekly with their mentor and 

* completing the coding assignment given to them

To help, we’ve created a software tool that allows the mentors to submit reports on their student’s progress. You’ll receive a link to this report each week at the email address you provided. 

**The report will answer the following questions:**

### How is the student doing, overall?
The **total grade** part of the report should give you a good idea, at a glance, of how a student is doing in the program. This is calculated from the grades their getting on their assignments as well as their attendance at their scheduled mentor meetings.

### Are students meeting with their mentor?
The **Meetings** section of the report shows you how many meetings the student has attended out of the total number of meetings. 

Mentors can indicate if the student was absent from their meeting. If the student was absent from their meeting and provided no notice or proof their absence was merited, this is displayed in the **Unexcused Absences** portion of the report. 

**Please note:** 
According to our policies, students are removed from the program after 3 unexcused absences from their mentor meetings.

### Are students completing their assignments?
On the report, there’s a section for “Assignments Completed.” This contains a number of assignments completed out of the total number of assignments.

### How are students doing on their assignments?
The avg. assignment grade section is an average of all grades given on student’s assignments. You can see an a list of all grades given on the student’s report profile.
