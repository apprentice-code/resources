## Reporting on student progress

During the course of the semester, we ask that the teacher of record ensure that students are:

* meeting with weekly with their mentor and 

*completing their assignments. 

To help, we’ve created a software tool that allows the mentors to submit reports on their student’s progress. You’ll receive a link to this report each week at the email address you provided. 

The report will answer the following questions:

### How is the student doing, overall?
The **total grade** part of the report should give you a good idea, at a glance, of how a student is doing in the program. This is calculated from the grades their getting on their assignments as well as their attendance at their scheduled mentor meetings.

### Are students meeting with their mentor?
The **mentor meetings** section of the report shows you how many meetings the student has attended out of the total number of meetings. 

Mentors can indicate if the student was absent from their meeting. If the student was absent from their meeting and provided no notice or proof their absence was merited, this is displayed in the **Unexcused Absences** portion of the report. 

**Please note:** 
According to our policies, students are removed from the program after 3 unexcused absences from their mentor meetings.

### Are students completing their assignments?
On the report, there’s a section for “Assignments Completed.” This contains a number of assignments completed out of the total number of assignments.

### How are students doing on their assignments?
The avg. assignment grade section is an average of all grades given on student’s assignments. You can see an a list of all grades given on the student’s report profile.
