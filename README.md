## Program Overview

### Lessons + Assignments
Code Apprentice works a lot like school. Each week, you'll have coding lessons using an online curriculum we provide. After completion of the learning material, you'll work on an assignment that will help you put into practice the coding skills you just learned. [Lessons](https://github.com/apprentice-code/curriculum/tree/master/lessons) can be found in the [curriculum folder](https://github.com/apprentice-code/curriculum) here on Github. 

Learn more about [lessons](#weekly-lessons) and [assignments](#assignments).

### Mentor Meetings
At the start of the program, we'll match you with a professional developer who will be your mentor during the course of the semester. Each week, you'll meet over video chat with your mentor to review what you’re learning, ask them any questions, and work with them on educational coding projects. 

Learn more about [mentor meetings](#mentor-meetings).

### Events
Throughout the semester, you and other Code Apprentice students from around the area will get a chance to tour tech companies and meet together to hear talks from people in the industry on subjects like Artificial Intelligence and tech entrepreneurship. Attendance at these events will factor into your final grade and the hours needed to earn a credit.

[View the timeline]() to see a list of events. 

### Grading
Your final grade for Code Apprentice is based on the following factors:
- Attending your mentor meetings each week
- Your completion of the coding assignments and final project
- Your level of engagement and professionalism (Ex. asking questions of your mentor, level of effort put into assignments, engagement with other students in the program)

## Getting Started

### Checklist
- [ ] Create a Slack account
- [ ] Create a Zoom account
- [ ] Create a Github account
- [ ] Download text editor for coding
- [ ] Schedule your weekly mentor meetings

### 1. Creating a Slack Account
Slack is the tool we use for chat communication. We’ll use it primarily for announcements, but you can use it to ask questions of your mentor or just chat with other Code Apprentice students. We’ve sent a Slack invite to the email address you provided when you signed up for Code Apprentice. Follow the instructions to setup an account.

#### > Post a quick introduction in the #introductions channel
Once you're set up in Slack, post in the #introductions channel and tell everyone about yourself! _Quick tip: to insert a GIF, type `/giphy` + any word (example: `/giphy hello`) and send the message._

### 2. Creating a Zoom account
Zoom is app you’ll use for your weekly mentor meetings. You can video chat and share your screen so your mentor can see the code you’re working on. Use this [help document](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362033-Getting-Started-on-PC-and-Mac) to create a free Zoom account and download the software to use on your Mac or PC.

### 3. Creating a Github account
Github is the app that developers use to store and share the code they're working on. When you complete a project, you'll upload your code to Github so that your mentor can review it. Use this [step-by-step guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub) to create a free account and get started.

#### > After creating your account, send us your Github username
This is important! Make sure you send us your Github username so we can inform your mentor when you post your assignments. 

### 4. Download text editor for coding
**NEED COPY**

### 5. Scheduling your weekly mentor meeting
At the beginning of the program, your mentor will reach out via Slack or email to introduce themselves and work with you to find a good time each week for your video meetings.
