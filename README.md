## Getting Started

### Checklist
- [ ] Create a Slack account
- [ ] Create a Zoom account
- [ ] Download text editor for coding
- [ ] Schedule your weekly mentor meetings

### 1. Creating a Slack Account
Slack is the tool we use for chat communication. We’ll use it primarily for announcements, but you can use it to ask questions of your mentor or just chat with other Code Apprentice students. We’ve sent a Slack invite to the email address you provided when you signed up for Code Apprentice. Follow the instructions to setup an account.

#### > Post a quick introduction in the #introductions channel
Once you're set up in Slack, post in the #introductions channel and tell everyone about yourself! _Quick tip: to insert a GIF, type “/giphy” + any word (example: /giphy hello) and send the message._

### 2. Creating a Zoom account
Zoom is app you’ll use for your weekly mentor meetings. You can video chat and share your screen so your mentor can see the code you’re working on. Use this [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362033-Getting-Started-on-PC-and-Mac](help document) to create a free Zoom account and download the software to use on your Mac or PC.

### 3. Download text editor for coding
**NEED COPY**

### 4. Scheduling your weekly mentor meeting
At the beginning of the program, your mentor will reach out via Slack or email to introduce themselves and work with you to find a good time each week for your video meetings.

## Mentor Meetings
Your weekly meeting with your mentor is an opportunity to review what you’re learning, ask them any questions, and work with them on the “mentor guided learning” section of your weekly lesson. 

### Preparing for your meeting
Make sure you’ve completed all, or most, of your self-guided learning for that week so you can use the time with your mentor to review what you’ve learned and ask them questions. 

### Cancellation
Your attendance at your mentor meetings is a factor in your final grade. If you have to cancel for any reason please notify your mentor in advance and provide a reason for cancellation.

## Events
Throughout the semester, you and other Code Apprentice students from around the area will get a chance to tour tech companies and meet together to hear talks from people in the industry on subjects like Artificial Intelligence and tech entrepreneurship. Attendance at these events will factor into your final grade and the hours needed to earn a credit.
