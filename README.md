# Student Handbook

## Weekly Lessons

### Self Guided Learning
Your learning material for the week. Your Assignment and Mentor-Guided Learning project are designed to test your knowledge of what was covered.
  
### Resources
If you’d like to learn more about what was covered in the Self-Guided Learning section of the lesson, we’ve provided some additional videos and articles that can help explain things further.

### Mentor-Guided Learning
If you have time during your weekly meeting with your mentor, you can both work through this project to reinforce what you learned in the self-guided learning portion of the lesson. 
  
### Extension*
If you’re feeling ambitious, you can use the instructions provided in the extension section to keep learning and get a head start on next week’s assignment.

## Assignment
You’ll find a link in your weekly lesson to the assignment for that week. Follow the instructions provided, and then publish your work to Github so it can be reviewed by your mentor. 

### Grading
Once your work has been submitted to Github, your mentor will be notified and will review it to assign a grade with some comments.

## Mentor Meetings
Your weekly meeting with your mentor is an opportunity to review what you’re learning, ask them any questions, and potentially work with them on the “mentor guided learning” section of your weekly lesson. 

### Preparing for your meeting
Make sure you’ve completed all, or most, of your self-guided learning for that week so you can use the time with your mentor to review what you’ve learned and ask them questions. 

### Cancellation
Your attendance at your mentor meetings is a factor in your final grade, so if you have to cancel for any reason please notify your mentor in advance and provide a reason for cancellation.

## Events
Throughout the semester, you and other Code Apprentice students from around the area will get a chance to tour tech companies and meet together to discuss coding and hear talks from people in the industry on subjects like Artificial Intelligence and tech entrepreneurship. Attendance at these events will factor into your final grade and the hours needed to earn a credit.
